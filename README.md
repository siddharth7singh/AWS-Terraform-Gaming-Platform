I have created a fully fledged Architecture Diagram for a Gaming platform. I also have created Terraform code for the same. It took a lot of time and effort to meet this requirement. I took into consideration how the integration of different AWS services should be to make a best possible robust architecture for it.

Terraform code github repository path : https://github.com/siddharth7singh/Terraform-Code/blob/main/gaming_platform.tf

This architecture addresses all the requirements, including scalability, low-latency gameplay, security, high availability, data storage, container orchestration, logging and monitoring, notifications, DDoS protection, self-healing infrastructure and load distribution. 

Terraform code automates the deployment of the infrastructure, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
